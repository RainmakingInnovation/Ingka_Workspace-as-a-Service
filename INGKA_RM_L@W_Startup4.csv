Tilt,"Crowdtilt is a group-funding platform that allows users to establish fundraising campaigns and pre-selling campaigns. The company is legally certified in securing fundraisers for non-profit organizations. The company's principal product is a group-funding platform that allows users to contribute to and create campaigns of their choosing. Every campaign is assigned a tilt point, which defines the minimum amount of funding needed to make the campaign successful. Users can contribute as much as they like, and campaign funds are only released if the tilt point is met. The company receives a 2.5% fee for each successful pre-sell campaign and fundraising campaigns are run for free. Offers mobile app, and developer API to allow third-party integration of the Crowdtilt group payment functionality into any application. In February 2014 Crowdtilt made its open source, white-label solution, CrowdtiltOpen, available to all businesses, brands and project creators who want to launch crowdfunding pages on their own sites.",http://tilt.com,Finance​,Financing,,,,,,,2012,0,United States of America,North America,Yes,Acquired,"$67,220,000.00",,Mature,,,FALSE,FALSE,"SV Angel
